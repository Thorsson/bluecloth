Bluecloth is a Ruby implementation of [Markdown][1], a text-to-HTML conversion
tool for web writers. To quote from the project page: Markdown allows you to
write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to
structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

It borrows a naming convention and several helpings of interface from
[Redcloth][2], [Why the Lucky Stiff][3]'s processor for a similar text-to-HTML
conversion syntax called [Textile][4].
