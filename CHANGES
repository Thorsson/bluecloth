== Since Mislav forked the project from SVN

  * bin/bluecloth doesn't add <html><body> tags by default; instead it's opt-in
  * deleted legacy files (tests/, test.rb, docs/, experiments/, install.rb, ...)
  * break lib/bluecloth.rb into submodules under lib/transform/
  * converted tests to specs, cleaner suite
  * import latest original Markdown.pl for reference (and testing)
